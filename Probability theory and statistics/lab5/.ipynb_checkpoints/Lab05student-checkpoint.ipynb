    " * Look up how likely is getting an $S$ value as large as the one you obtained if it has that distribution, i.e. the $p$-value. To do this use **scipy.stats.chi2.cdf**. If this value turns out smaller than the assumed threshold, e.g. $0.05$, we reject $H_0$. Otherwise we do not (we support $H_0$), but this does not mean $H_0$ is proved!\n",
    " * We mentioned earlier that expected counts for the buckets need to be large enough. \"Large enough\" assumption here is used to guarantee that $c_i$ are distributed approximately normally. Typically one requires that all counts are at least $5$. This is not the case in our problem (unless we take a huge sample) because of the errors in the data. The typical approach is to glue several buckets into one but this does not help in our case. Instead, ignore the erroneous dates when computing $c_i$ and $f_i$ and run the test again (on the same sample!). Remember to use a different number of degrees of freedom. Compare the results. \n",
